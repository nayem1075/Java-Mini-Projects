#  Java Basic Management Projects

This repository contains a collection of **basic Java projects** I developed as part of my learning journey during my university coursework.  
These projects were assigned by **Debabarata Mallick Sir**, and they helped me understand how Java can be used to build small-scale, real-life management systems.


##  Projects Included

The following projects are included in this repository:

-  **ATM System** — Basic console-based ATM simulation (balance check, withdraw, deposit)
-  **Hotel Management System** — Booking, checkout, room availability handling
-  **Library Management System** — Issue, return, and search for books
-  **Online Shopping System** — Add to cart, view items, billing calculation
-  **Hospital Management System** — Patient records, doctor assignment, billing
-  **Banking System** — Simple bank account creation, deposit/withdraw, balance display
-  **Student Registration System** — Register students with details and display data
-  **Airline Reservation System** — Book and cancel tickets, check flight availability

> All of these are **console-based applications**, written in **Java**, using core concepts such as conditional statements, loops, arrays, and user input.

##  Skills Practiced

Through these projects, I practiced and improved the following Java skills:

- Control Flow (`if`, `switch`, `for`, `while`, `do-while`)
- Working with Arrays and Strings
- Creating modular code using methods
- Menu-driven application structure
- Taking user input using `Scanner`
- Basic error checks using conditions

 **Note:** These projects do **not use file handling** or advanced OOP features. They are focused on logic building and console interaction only.


##  Technology Stack

- **Language:** Java  
- **IDE Used:** NetBeans / VS Code  
- **Interface:** Text-based Console (No GUI / No File System)


##  Purpose

These mini-projects simulate how real-life systems work in a simplified way.  
They helped me understand how to **break down a problem**, write clean logic, and improve my Java basics.

This repository is my **practice record**, and I hope it helps other beginner students as well.
